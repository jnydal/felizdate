# FelizDate 💘

**FelizDate** is a real-time, full-stack dating platform built for performance, scalability, and responsive user experience.  
It was developed as a personal project with the ambition to compete with mainstream dating services — featuring instant messaging, geolocation, and a smooth single-page JavaScript interface optimized for both desktop and mobile.

## Key Features

- **Real-time chat** with WebSocket integration (like Facebook Messenger)
- **100% JavaScript-based client** for ultra-fast UI updates
- **Responsive design** – one unified codebase for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Cloud optimized** using Amazon S3 & CloudFront for static and media delivery
- **User-friendly profile dialogs** and multi-conversation support in a single browser tab
- **Geospatial support** (location-based matching)
- **Internationalization (i18n)** and multilingual interface
- **Facebook registration** for quick onboarding
- **JSON-based API** for lightweight client-server communication
- **Server stack ready for horizontal scaling**

## System Architecture

### Client-Side
- Built using **MooTools** and **jQuery** for DOM handling  
- Designed as a **single-page app** running on **Apache Cordova** for mobile integration  
- Handles:
  - `performAction(request)`  
  - `handleSuccessResponse(response)`  
  - `handleErrorResponse(response)`  
  - `handlePushResponse(response)`  
- Follows an **MVC-like pattern**:
  - **Controller** – business logic & request handling  
  - **ObservableModel** – event-based state updates  
  - **View** – dynamic rendering, dialogs, menus, and profile views  

**Advantages:**
- One client codebase across all devices
- Minimal cross-browser issues
- Easier maintenance and faster innovation cycles

---

### Server-Side
- **Frameworks:** Tornado (WebSocket handling) + Django (HTTP/Wsgi + ORM)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 8.4 with PostGIS 2.0 for geolocation  
- **Caching:** Memcached + pgBouncer connection pooling  
- **Web Server:** Nginx + HAProxy for load balancing  
- **App Servers:** Gunicorn (9 workers) for main app, plus dedicated chat worker  
- **CDN & Storage:** Amazon S3 + CloudFront  

**Server endpoints (simplified):**
```text
Login(…)
Logout(…)
setStatus(…)
getUserSession(…)
setPosition(…)
getProfile(…)
sendMessage(…)
...
```

**Django Models include:**
`UserProfile`, `Message`, `Media`, `Interest`, `Membership`, `PendingProfileImages`, `Worker`, `City`, `Occupation`, `Religion`, etc.
